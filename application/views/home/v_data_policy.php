        Read below for the actual license but the gist is that you can use the illustrations
        in any project, commercial or personal without attribution or any costs.
        Just donâ€™t try to replicate unDraw, redistribute in packs the illustrations or
        create integrations for it.

        a rule of thumb (tldr)
        If you are working on something and want to use illustrations to improve its
        appearance, modified or not, without the need for attribution or cost,
        you are good to go. If you find unDraw or its illustrations to be in the center of
        what you are doing (e.g. sell or re-distribute one/some of them,
        add them in an app), then you probably should not proceed.
